## Problem Statement

ClimateBench is a benchmark dataset for climate model emulation inspired by WeatherBench. It consists of NorESM2 simulation outputs with associated forcing data processed in to a consistent format from a variety of experiments performed for CMIP6. Multiple ensemble members are included where available.

The processed training and validation data can be obtained from Zenodo: [10.5281/zenodo.5196512].
